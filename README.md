#Getting Started

FCC Design Standards were originally created for the FCC GIS Program to maintain a consistent user experience across maps, visualizations, and other applications. The Design Standards cover foundational styles, individual components, and complex patterns. They define how interactions behave, what they look like, and how they could be implemented.
Supporting files

The design theme is built with the following libraries:

- Bootstrap 3.3.5
- Font Awesome
- jQuery
- Mapbox
- Leaflet

###Browser support

Please refer to the Bootstrap framework documentation for more information on [browser support](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support). At a minimum, the design standards support the latest versions of the following browsers.

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer

###Accessibility

When implementing any of the user interface components, please ensure that they meet [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](http://www.section508.gov/) accessibility requirements.

####Attribution
These standards were derived from the [USPTO UI Design Library](https://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/) along with guidance from the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) and [CFPB Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/index.html) in order to support best-practices for design across the U.S. Government. We hope the FCC Design Standards can serve as a foundation for discussing and practicing human-centered design in government.
