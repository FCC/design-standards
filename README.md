#FCC Design Standards

FCC Design Standards were originally created for the FCC GIS Program to maintain a consistent user experience across maps, visualizations, and other applications. The Design Standards cover foundational styles, individual components, and complex patterns. They define how interactions behave, what they look like, and how they could be implemented.

###Attribution
These standards were derived from the [USPTO UI Design Library](https://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/) along with guidance from the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) and [CFPB Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/index.html) in order to support best-practices for design across the U.S. Government. We hope the FCC Design Standards can serve as a foundation for discussing and practicing human-centered design in government.
